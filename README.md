# Eo Design Patterns

## Goal and Motivation
To analyse design patterns by implementing some popular design patterns in EO. This is to help better assess the EO programming language and suggest alternatives of design patterns in EO that could replace such patterns which are not supported in the language.
This repository contains descriptions and EO implementation of some popular software design patterns.

## Implemented patterns
Description of the design patterns analysis is available [here](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/tree/main/tex).
The following design patterns are implemented:
- [Abstract Fabric](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/AbstractFabric.eo)
- [Adapter](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Adapter.eo)
- [Bridge](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Bridge.eo)
- [ChainOfResponsibility](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/ChainOfResponsibility.eo)
- [Command](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Command.eo)
- [Composite](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Composite.eo)
- [Decorator](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Decorator.eo)
- [Mediator](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/Mediator.eo)
- [Null object](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/eodesignpatterns/blob/main/eo/NullObject.eo)
